# Dotbot

A custom Discord bot used for HTTP interactions only. This allows the bot to scale for redundancy if needed.

# Local Development

Navigate to the /localdev directory, populate the Discord__BotToken environment variable with your Discord bot token, and run docker-compose up.
If you don't have a token already then follow the [instructions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps) provided by Discord.
